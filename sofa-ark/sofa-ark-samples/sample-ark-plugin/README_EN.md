# How to build an ark-plugin
## Introduction
This sample project shows how to build an `ark-plugin`
based on a normal java project with the tool of `sofa-ark-plugin-maven-plugin`

## Background
Assuming such a situation, you develop a lib, however, some dependency 
conflict occurs when imported to the consumer project. To avoid this 
problem, you would hope to isolate your lib with the consumer project.
`Ark-Plugin` employs the mechanism of classloader isolation. It runs on 
`Ark-Container`, any `ark-plugin` would be loaded by an independent classloader.

There are four concepts about `ark-plugin`:

+ Exported Class: classes contained in `ark-plugin`，loaded by ark-plugin-classloader,
but can be resolved by other `ark-plugin` (if it imports) or consumer project.

+ Imported Class: if a `ark-plugin` configures this item, it prefers to resolve class 
from other `ark-plugin` which exports corresponding class.

+ Exported Resource: resources contained in `ark-plugin`，loaded by ark-plugin-classloader,
but can be found by other `ark-plugin` (if it imports) or consumer project.

+ Imported Resource: if a `ark-plugin` configures this item, it prefers to find resource 
from other `ark-plugin` which exports corresponding resource.

## Tools 
The `Maven plugin` of `sofa-ark-plugin-maven-plugin` is provided to build a
standard `ark-plugin`, and just needs some simple configurations. Details please
refer to [doc](https://alipay.github.io/sofastack.github.io/docs/build-ark-plugin.html)

## Step by Step
### Create a Maven Project
This sample project is a standard maven project, it contains two modules:

+ common module: contains some classes exported.
+ plugin module: contains `plugin activator` and `plugin service`.

One thing should be pointed out that dependencies imported by project also can be exported.

### Configure sofa-ark-plugin-maven-plugin
The maven plugin of `sofa-ark-plugin-maven-plugin` is configured in the `pom.xml` of plugin
module, it configures as follows:

``` java
<executions>
    <execution>
        <id>default-cli</id>
        
        <!-- goal executed to generate ark-plugin -->
        <goals>
            <goal>ark-plugin</goal>
        </goals>

        <configuration>

            <!--can only configure no more than one activator-->
            <activator>com.alipay.sofa.ark.sample.activator.SamplePluginActivator</activator>

            <!-- configure exported class -->
            <exported>
                <!-- configure package-level exported class-->
                <packages>
                    <package>com.alipay.sofa.ark.sample.common</package>
                </packages>

                <!-- configure class-level exported class -->
                <classes>
                    <class>com.alipay.sofa.ark.sample.facade.SamplePluginService</class>
                </classes>
                
                <!-- configure exported resource -->
                 <resources>
                    <resource>Sample_Resource_Exported</resource>
                </resources>
            </exported>
            </exported>

            <!--specify destination where ark-plugin will be saved, default saved to ${project.build.directory}-->
            <outputDirectory>../target</outputDirectory>

        </configuration>
    </execution>
</executions>
```
The configured items are explained as follows:
+ `activator`: startup entry of `ark-plugin` when running on `ark-container`; generally speaking,
`ark-plugin service` would be published in the entry, similar to what [`SamplePluginActivator`](./plugin/src/main/java/com/alipay/sofa/ark/sample/activator/SamplePluginActivator.java) does.
+ `exported pacakges`: the package of `com.alipay.sofa.ark.sample.common` is exported, any class
whose name start with `com.alipay.sofa.ark.sample.common` would be exported.
+ `exported classes`: the single class `com.alipay.sofa.ark.sample.facade.SamplePluginService` is
exported.
+ `exported resource`: the resource `Sample_Resource_Exported` is exported.
+ `outputDirectory`: specify destination where ark-plugin would be saved when execute
the maven command of `mvn package`

### package/install/deploy
+ package: execute `mvn package`, the ark-plugin file generated would be saved to the configured 
value of `outputDirectory`.
+ install: execute `mvn install`, the ark-plugin would be installed local maven repository, its maven
location would bring a classifier of `ark-plugin`.
+ deploy: execute `mvn deploy`, just as usual practice.

### import
As what mentioned above, the maven location of ark-plugin would bring with a classifier
of `ark-plugin`, so, to import the ark-plugin generated by this sample project, you
should add the following dependency in your consumer project:

```
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.alipay.sofa</groupId>
     <artifactId>sample-ark-plugin</artifactId>
     <classifier>ark-plugin</classifier>
     <version>0.5.2</version>
 </dependency>
```
